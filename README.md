# Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or not based on various financial and personal attributes. The dataset includes features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, marital status, and more.
# Data-Analysis-Using-Python-Decision-Tree-and-Naive-Bayes-
The goal of this project is to build and compare different machine learning models to classify loan eligibility. Two algorithms were implemented and evaluated:  Decision Tree Classifier – Achieved an accuracy of 70%  Naive Bayes Classifier – Achieved an accuracy of 82%
